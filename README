DESCRIPTION
This plugin changes the star command *, so that it doesn't jump to the next
match. (Unless you supply a [count], so 1* now restores the old * behavior.)
If you issue a star command on the same text as before, the search
highlighting is turned off (via :nohlsearch); the search pattern remains
set, so a n / N command will turn highlighting on again. With this, you
can easily toggle highlighting for the current word / visual selection.

With the disabling of the jump to the next match, there is no difference
between * and # any more, so the # key can now be used for some other mapping.

This plugin also extends the star command to visual mode, where instead of
the current word, the selected text is used as the literal search pattern.

The auto-search functionality instantly highlights the word under the cursor
when typing or moving around. This can be helpful while browsing source code;
whenever you position the cursor on an identifier, all other occurrences are
instantly highlighted. This functionality is toggled on/off via <Leader>*. You
can also :nohlsearch to temporarily disable the highlighting.

SEE ALSO
- mark.vim (vimscript #2666) can highlight several patterns in different
  colors simultaneously.
- SearchAlternatives.vim (vimscript #4146) can add and subtract search
  alternatives via mappings and commands.
- To also show the number of matches when selecting a word (*, g* etc.),
  you can append the corresponding command to the <Plug> mapping (see
  SearchHighlighting-remap):
    nmap <silent> * <Plug>SearchHighlightingStar:%s///gn<CR>
 The SearchPosition.vim plugin (vimscript #2634) provides an extended
  version of that command.

RELATED WORKS
I came up with this on my own; however, the idea can be traced back to
francoissteinmetz and da.thompson in the comments of vimtip #1 (now at
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip1):
    map <silent> <F10> :set invhls<CR>:let @/="<C-r><C-w>"<CR>

- highlight_word_under_cursor.vim (vimscript #4287) implements the search
  auto-highlighting of the whole and optionally current word.
- HiCursorWords (vimscript #4306) highlights the word under the cursor, with
  optional delay and limited to certain syntax groups.
- Matchmaker (https://github.com/qstrahl/vim-matchmaker) highlights the word
  under the cursor with matchadd(), not the current search pattern.
- star search (vimscript #4335) changes the behavior of * to not jump to the
  next match, and includes the visual search from the next plugin
- https://github.com/bronson/vim-visual-star-search provides searching of the
  visual selection
- visualstar.vim (vimscript #2944) provides searching of the visual selection

USAGE
*                       Toggle search highlighting for the current whole
                        \<word\> on/off.
g*                      Toggle search highlighting for the current word
                        on/off.
{Visual}*               Toggle search highlighting for the selection on/off.
                        For a blockwise-visual selection, not just lines
                        that match the block's lines on their own are matched,
                        but all occurrences that contain the block's text,
                        though not just with the same vertical alignment (that
                        isn't possible to assert with Vim's regular
                        expressions), and only the first line's match is
                        highlighted. For example, a match on
                            foo
                            bar
                        will also match all three occurrences in
                            foo    my foo is        tell foo
                            bar    inside bar               bar
                        but not a single
                            foo

[count]*                Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
[count]g*               word nearest to the cursor.
{Visual}[count]*

[count],*               Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
                        word under the cursor, keeping the cursor at the
                        current position within the word's matches (via
                        search-offset).
                        Observes the new non-jumping behavior of the star
                        commands without a [count].

<Leader>*               Toggle auto-search highlighting (using the last
                        {what}; default is "wword").

:SearchAutoHighlighting [{what}]
                        Turn on automatic highlighting of occurrences of
                        {what} in normal mode, and the selected text in visual
                        / select mode. Possible values:
                        wword: whole cword, like star; this is the default
                        wWORD: whole cWORD, delimited by whitespace
                        cword: current word under cursor
                        cWORD: current WORD under cursor
                        line:  current text in line, excluding indent and
                               trailing whitespace
                        exactline: exact current line

:NoSearchAutoHighlighting
                        Turn off automatic highlighting.
